This code shows a chaotic encoding method from a research paper [1]. The method is used to solve the problem of variable-length representation. It is applied in the SIS algorithm [2], which is a type of metaheuristic algorithm. The goal is to optimize wind farm layouts when the number of wind turbines changes. The chaotic encoding helps handle the changing number of turbines during the optimization.
